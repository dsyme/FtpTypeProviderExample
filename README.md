# Example of Creating an FTP type provider

This repo was based on a live demo of creating a somewhat rudimentary FTP type provider given at the Summer School on Generic Programming in Oxford in July 2015.

The particular motivation is to strongly explore and name the extraordinaryily rich contents of the bioinformatics data at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov - basically most of the worlds genomics information is here.

[FtpProvider.fs](https://github.com/dsyme/FtpTypeProviderExample/blob/master/FtpProvider/FtpProvider/FtpProvider.fs) - The rudimentary type provider implementation

[MyFirstTypeProviderPristine](https://github.com/dsyme/FtpTypeProviderExample/tree/master/MyFirstTypeProvider-Pristine) - The empty type provider

[MyFirstTypeProvider](https://github.com/dsyme/FtpTypeProviderExample/tree/master/MyFirstTypeProvider) - The type provider after the live coding session, this has a user/password feature added
